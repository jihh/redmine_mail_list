# Redmine Notice

As an administrator of Redmine, have you ever wished to send a message to some user (or all of them)?
For example, "Server will be shut down for maintenance!"
How do you accomplish this before?

Do you create a public project? Do you add all user to this project? Do you create a news in this project?
It's inconvenient, isn't it?

Well, you can use this plugin now!!
